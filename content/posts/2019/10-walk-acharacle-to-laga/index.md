In 2005 the [Land Reform (Scotland) Act](https://www.scotways.com/faq/law-on-statutory-access-rights) came into force. This wonderful piece of legislation gives everyone rights of access over land and inland water throughout Scotland.

These rights are sometimes referred to as _'freedom to roam'_ or _'right to roam'_.

There are specific exclusions _e.g._ fields with growing crops, gardens (!), and there is a requirement to behave responsibly. All very reasonable.

Without this legislation, walking would often be restricted to rights of way such as footpaths and bridlepaths, often long-established.

And Ardnamurchan has [relatively few](https://www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/download/198/core_paths_in_lochaber) of these.

## Coast to coast

The settlements on Ardnamurchan are situated on the periphery of the peninsula. The sheltered moorings at Salen, Glenborrodale bay with its castle and Kilchoan on the southern shoreline. Sanna, the hamlets of Kilmory and Ockle on the north coast, and Acharacle at the mouth of Loch Shiel.

{{< figure src="images/Screenshot-2019-10-14-17.47.58.png" caption="Ardnamurchan peninsula map" alt="Ardnamurchan peninsula map" >}}

These places are still linked by tracks across the relatively barren hinterland. On the north shore of Loch Sunart the winding B8007 presumably follows a historic cart track and, before then, a route used by farmers going to and from Ardgour.

However, along the north coast and linking the north and south coasts, a number of tracks remain. These provide relatively unchallenging walking over some beautiful empty hills and moors, often offering stunning views across the peninsula.

One of my favourites is the track from Acharacle to Glenborrodale.

{{< figure src="images/190815-045.jpg" caption="Kentra Moss" alt="Kentra Moss" >}}

Recent forestry activity at the Glenborrodale end of the track has made access more difficult (more on this later) and left an ugly scar on the landscape.

I therefore recommend walking north to south (starting from Acharacle) and deviating from the Glenborrodale track to instead finish at Laga.

## Acharacle and Kentra Moss

The easiest point to start from is Acharacle Primary School (NM 67448 68069). This is a short walk north along the A861 from the bustling metropolis of Acharacle.

Don't let the the 'A' prefix on the road number mislead you. Parts of it are single track.

{{< figure src="images/Screenshot-2019-10-13-00.02.51.png" caption="Acharacle, Arivegaig and Kentra Moss map" alt="Acharacle, Arivegaig and Kentra Moss map" >}}

There's a small parking area just west of the school, with a gate leading to the track to Arevigaig that winds through the _Bealach Clach an Aighe_ [^903].

{{< figure src="images/190815-049.jpg" caption="Birch and bog, Kentra Moss" alt="Birch and bog, Kentra Moss" >}}

You emerge from the scrubby mixed birch woodland onto the south eastern edge of Kentra Moss. This, together with [Claish Moss](https://www.nature.scot/enjoying-outdoors/snh-nature-reserves/claish-moss-nature-reserve) on the southern shore of Loch Shiel, is one of the rare 'eccentric' mires in the UK. This habitat is characterised by oceanic blanket bog, rich in mosses, sphagnum, cross-leaved heath and bogbean.

Stick to the track. This amount of sphagnum doesn't flourish without very large amounts of water. The raised bog isn't safe to walk on, and would be damaged if you did.

{{< figure src="images/190815-051.jpg" caption="Kentra Moss ... very wet everywhere" alt="Kentra Moss ... very wet everywhere" >}}

Kentra Moss is a great place for dragonflies and insectivorous plants, neither of which I'm much good at identifying. During the summer months the bird life is good, with a number of different breeding waders.

A couple of hundred metres after the track bears west you come to a junction with a concrete bridge over one of the many burns that drains the bog. Turn left here (bearing south) on a recently upgraded track leading up away from Kentra Moss into the low hills.

{{< figure src="images/190815-052.jpg" caption="Kentra Moss - track junction looking north" alt="Kentra Moss - track junction looking north" >}}

To see more of Kentra Moss there's also a [circular walk](https://www.wildlochaber.com/ardnamurchan/walking/kentra-moss-circular) that follows the track on to Arivegaig.

## Waterworks

There is a new water purification plant up the hill above Kentra Moss. The track goes past a large agricultural-looking building and a water tank with a fabulous view across Kentra Bay to Eigg and Rum before abruptly petering out at a gate held closed with a rusty chain.

{{< figure src="images/190815-057.jpg" caption="View across Kentra Bay to Eigg and Rum." alt="View across Kentra Bay to Eigg and Rum." >}}

The track changes from reasonably well-graded crushed rock to a more typical gnarly mountain track, largely suitable for a good 4WD vehicle, an [Argo ATV](https://arvs.co.uk), a mountain bike (and fit rider) or Vibram-soled boots.

Here, and increasingly on the route south, the track offers the 'path of least' resistance to water, so it's not unusual to be walking up a shallow stream.

There's plenty of evidence of the previous glaciation of the region, with rocks bearing characteristic linear scarring where glaciers have advanced or retreated.

{{< figure src="images/190815-062.jpg" caption="Glacier was 'ere" alt="Glacier was 'ere" >}}

The track climbs gently before cresting the ridge and dropping to a sturdy wooden bridge over the _Allt Beithe_ (Birch stream).

{{< figure src="images/180721-038.jpg" caption="Bridge over Allt Beithe" alt="Bridge over Allt Beithe" >}}

After crossing the stream the track gets smaller and wetter, climbing across the hill in a south-easterly direction towards Ben Laga.

As the track approaches Loch Laga the land levels out and it gets very wet underfoot. The water just stands around waiting to overtop your boots, rather than conveniently running away downhill.

But the view opens out to the south and east, particularly if you climb a little way above the track (but don't leave a [cairn](/2019/09/environmental-vandalism/) to spoil the landscape for others). It feels remote but isn't really.

{{< figure src="images/190815-088.jpg" caption="The Sunart hills" alt="The Sunart hills" >}}

On a poor day, with heavy cloud and squally showers, the views are less good, or potentially non-existent. However, don't forget to scan the surrounding ridges for eagles - I've often seen them here, particularly when the weather is less than favourable.

## Loch Laga

Loch Laga lies in the boggy ground between _Meall nan Each_ and Ben Laga, east of the Fiddler's Slab (_Leac an Fhidhleir_). There's a small corrugated fishing hut at Loch Laga and I assume the fishing is controlled by the Ardnamurchan Estate, though I've not been able to confirm this.

{{< figure src="images/190815-086.jpg" caption="Approaching Loch Laga." alt="Approaching Loch Laga." >}}

It's an exposed spot and it's not unusual for the loch to be covered in short, white-capped waves. This is a good place to see both red and black throated divers. I wouldn't be surprised if at least one of them bred on the small rocky island in the Loch.

{{< figure src="images/190815-094.jpg" caption="Loch Laga" alt="Loch Laga" >}}

As the track skirts the west shore of the loch it is indistinct in places and heavily eroded in others, with the latter likely due to over-enthusiastic (or ambitious) access with an Argo on the peaty soil.

The track rises gently, curving in a more westerly direction. About half a mile after the fishing hut there's a small cairn in the heather on the left side of the track (NM636632).

This marks the junction with a smaller track leading to Laga.

## Cairn do

From the Acharacle to Glenborrodale track, this spur off to Laga is almost invisible. Perhaps this is one of the few times when a [cairn is useful](/2019/09/environmental-vandalism/). Approaching from the west there's a tendency to turn south too soon and the ground is very rough and boggy. Not recommended.

After a hundred metres or so the track rises on a rocky spur leading south. Underfoot the going is good except for a few extensively boggy areas. None of these offer too much of a problem if you're willing to skirt around them and take a _'leap of faith'_ (from one semi-dry tussock to another) a few times.

{{< figure src="images/190815-100.jpg" caption="Track to Laga" alt="Track to Laga" >}}

The track descends very gently towards Laga. With every step the views across Morvern, the Isle of Carna and Loch Sunart expand and improve.

Keep an eye on the rocky ridge of Ben Laga to your east. This is a good place to see eagles, though the prevailing wind tends to need to be south-westerly or westerly.

{{< figure src="images/190815-103.jpg" caption="From outside in - Laga Farm native woodland" alt="From outside in - Laga Farm native woodland" >}}

The descent steepens and a deer fence appears to the west. This marks the boundary of the Laga Farm native woodland development.

## The end is nigh

In a fold in the hillside a heavy angled gate appears in the deer fence which enables you to cross into the land enclosed by the Laga Farm fencing.

{{< figure src="images/190815-104.jpg" caption="From inside out - open moorland to the east of the Laga Farm native woodland enclosed area" alt="From inside out - open moorland to the east of the Laga Farm native woodland enclosed area" >}}

Within metres the difference is striking.

Inside the protective deer fence there are trees growing all over the place. Inevitably many these will have been planted, but lots of the birch, rowan _etc_ will be self-seeded.

In contrast, outside the fence, the moorland is barren with barely a tree in sight. The only exceptions are those growing in inaccessible clefts on the steepest slopes, or in the ravines through which the streams tumble.

This is compelling evidence that there are [too many deer](/2019/08/deer-and-reforestation/).

{{< figure src="images/190815-106.jpg" caption="Laga Farm native woodland, looking south across Loch Sunart to Morvern" alt="Laga Farm native woodland, looking south across Loch Sunart to Morvern" >}}

The next kilometre or so are increasingly steep and increasingly wooded. It's lovely now and it's getting better year after year as the trees mature.

The gravelly and rocky path still offers the _'path of least resistance'_ to water which, in turn, provides miniature pools for dragonflies to lay eggs, like this [golden-ringed dragonfly](https://british-dragonflies.org.uk/species/golden-ringed-dragonfly/).

{{< vimeo 366295926 >}}

Finally the track levels out and you reach a gate through the deer fencing which brings you out onto the [B8007](/2019/02/b8007-the-road-to-everywhere/).

Turn left for the fleshpots of Salen and all points east, turn right for civilisation, Glenborrodale and Kilchoan.

{{< figure src="images/190815-117.jpg" caption="Loch Sunart, near Laga" alt="Loch Sunart, near Laga" >}}

It's worth noting that parking at Laga is very restricted. The road is single track and the passing places are heavily used for, er, passing. Don't park in them! Laga Bay is also the base for [Mowi](https://mowiscotland.co.uk) in this part of the loch and some gateways are used for lorries turning. Finally, Laga is the base for [Ardnamurchan Charters](https://www.west-scotland-marine.com) (ferry to Mull, Carna and wildlife trips) and their parking area should not be used.

## Alternative ending

Rather than turn south at the cairned turn (NM636632) shortly after Loch Laga you can keep on the main track to Glenborrodale. The route turns more westerly and eventually turns south into Glen Borrodale. The going underfoot is much like the first half of the route, with some spectacularly wet and soggy bits.

The route crosses a couple of good-sized burns and bridges ensure your already soaked footwear doesn't get any wetter ;)

{{< figure src="images/180721-045.jpg" caption="Bridge over the Allt something or other" alt="Bridge over the Allt something or other" >}}


As the route bears south into Glen Borrodale there are a number of deer fences to negotiate. This area has recently been clear-felled and it is a rather barren and unattractive landscape. The track improves and so do the height of the deer fences.

If you are lucky the gates will be unlocked. If you're unlucky you will have to scale the 8 foot fences (usually relatively straightforward). In several visits over the last couple of years I've been lucky about 50% of the time.

{{< figure src="images/180721-050.jpg" caption="Trees were here ... but won't be again for a long time" alt="Trees were here ... but won't be again for a long time" >}}

So much for the _'right to roam'_.

This is a long-established route between Glenborrodale and Acharacle and is in many of the guidebooks to the area.

The deer fences [^710] are to protect the thousands of young (native thankfully) trees planted in the felled and adjacent areas of moorland. At my last visit these were only 30 - 60 cm tall, so there's some way to go before the forestry-induced scarring is hidden again.

The track finally descends through the Glenborrodale woodchip plant and emerges on the [B8007](/2019/02/b8007-the-road-to-everywhere/).

There are more places to park near Glenborrodale but the deforested landscape, locked gates and less impressive views make the Laga end to the walk preferable in my opinion.

{{< figure src="images/190815-098.jpg" caption="Loch Laga" alt="Loch Laga" >}}

The Acharacle - Laga walk is about 6 miles. The alternative ending in Glenborrodale is probably a mile or so longer.

The route and going underfoot is easy to moderate but remember to wear appropriate footwear and take waterproofs. This near to the Atlantic the weather can change - and often does - in minutes.

[^903]: I'm not going to guess at many of these translations ... this is something like Pass of the Ice Stones ... perhaps.
[^710]: But the lack of opening gates is disappointing and - as the Laga Farm example shows - easily remedied.
